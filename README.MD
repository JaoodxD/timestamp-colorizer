# Interval Colorizer
Package to determine which color to apply to time interval according to configs.

# For example:
00:05:00 (5 min) would be marked as green <span style="color: green;">00:05:00</span>.

01:00:00 (1 hour) would get yellow -> <span style="color: yellow;">01:00:00</span>.

18:00:00 (18 hours) could be mentioned as long time interval so it'd get red color <span style="color: red;">18:00:00</span>.
