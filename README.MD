# Interval Colorizer
Package to determine which color to apply to time interval according to configs.

# For example:
00:05:00 (5 min) would be marked as green `#00cc00`

01:00:00 (1 hour) would get yellow `#ffff00`.

18:00:00 (18 hours) could be mentioned as long time interval so it'd get red `#b52318` color.
